# About

Hi there! My name is Omar Chammaa. I have a BSc in Physics and Mathematics and an MSc in Theoretical Physics, both from McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Last year, I started work at a biotechnology startup called RemediumAI based in Montreal, where I work on a Machine Learning platform for protein-protein interaction prediction. My work involves software engineering, machine learning, and protein science aspects. I enjoy technical challenges, working in teams and communicating my thoughts, and even more so when I believe they produce a positive net impact society. My passion for challenging myself extends well beyond the workplace, where I spend my time becoming better at my craft(s). When I'm not thinking about AI, tech or retro-gaming, I am punching or getting punched in the face in a nearby boxing gym (most likely the latter).
